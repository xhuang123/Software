The PKscan program is a computational tool designed to predict pseudoknots in RNA sequences.Pseudoknots are complex RNA secondary structures formed when bases in a loop pair with a complementary sequence outside the loop, and they play important biological roles (e.g., in ribosomal frameshifting, viral replication, and gene expression regulation).
This PKscan program analyzes RNA sequences from input files and extracts pseudoknot information, including energy values, Start/end positions of pseudoknot, lengths of loops and stems and base-pairing diagram. It supports multiple input formats and generates summary outputs useful for RNA structure prediction and analysis.
